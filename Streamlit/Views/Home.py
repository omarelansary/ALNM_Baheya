                "<b>3. Mapping of sentinel lymph nodes</b>: The tracer material travels through the lymphatic channels to the sentinel lymph node(s), which are then identified by the surgeon.",
                "<b>4. Biopsy</b>: The surgeon removes the identified sentinel lymph node(s) for examination under a microscope."
